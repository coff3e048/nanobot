# nanobot

nanobot is a small but (soon to be) feature rich general purpose Discord bot written in Python. This bot is not considered usable or stable at the moment, so contributions are welcome 

# Dependencies

`pip install -U nextcord psutil colorama python-dotenv`

are dependencies that are required to run nanobot in its current state.

# Goals

- Create moderation commands (ban, mute, etc.)
- Create guild-specific data (custom prefix, RSS, etc)
- More "fun" commands
- Slash commands?
- Sort cogs into folders
